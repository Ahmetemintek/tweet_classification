# Classification about is the tweets about real disaster or not?
I got datas from kaggle and submitted to competition. <br/>
The repository consist 4 files: <br/>

**train.csv** This is train dataset. <br/>
**test.csv** This is the test dataset. <br/>
**sample_submission.csv** This is the sample submission format of Kaggle competition. <br/>
**USE_disaster_project.ipynb** This is the notebook file of project.  <br/>

I use SparkNLP package on this project. And I implemented Universal Sentence Encoder as pre-processing step.
